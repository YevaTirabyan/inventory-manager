Welcome to the Item Upgrade System!
This program allows you to create, manage, and upgrade game items based on their rarity.
Simulate an inventory, combine items to increase their rarity, and explore the upgrade mechanics.

✨ Features

🔹 Item Creation: Add items with unique names and specified rarity.
🔹 Upgrade Mechanics:
⬆️ Upgrade items by combining them with others of the same rarity and type.
⭐ Progress through rarity levels: Common → Great → Rare → Epic → Legendary.
⚙️ Special mechanics for Epic items: Epic → Epic 1 → Epic 2.
🔹 Error Handling: Invalid operations are gracefully handled with clear error messages.


📌 Assumptions and Design Choices

🛠️ Upgrade Logic: Strict adherence to the rules for simplicity and consistency.
⏳ Time Constraints: Some features were deprioritized due to the time limit, focusing on core functionality.


🚧 Missing Features

❌ Update Feature: The ability to modify existing items (e.g., change name or rarity) was planned but not implemented.
❌ Save/Load: Inventory data is not persisted between sessions.
❌ Random Item Generation: A feature to generate items based on rarity probabilities has not been implemented.


🔮 Future Improvements

💾 Implement save and load functionality for inventory persistence.
🎲 Add random item generation with weighted probabilities for rarities.
🛡️ Improve error handling with more detailed feedback to the user.


✍️ Author’s Note
This project was completed as part of a time-constrained coding task.
The focus was on delivering a functional prototype, with opportunities for future extensions and optimizations.

This version maintains clarity while adding a professional and visually appealing style!
